# AI VIDEO PROMPT – Logo animation (Symbol Personality aligned)

**Prompt:**

> Create a calm, elegant logo animation for a premium landing page.
>
> Four minimalist circular symbols animate and organically transform into one unified final logo.
> Each symbol represents a distinct role and personality within a shared system:
>
> **Symbol 1 – (core / community):**
> A calm central presence representing the core, community, and shared space.
> It embodies openness, balance, and potential.
> This symbol acts as a unifying element — a place of return, framing, or silent stability.
>
> **Symbol 2 – Men’s Circles (axis / tree):**
> A vertical, grounded symbol representing structure, responsibility, and growth.
> Inspired by the archetype of a tree: roots, trunk, and branches.
> Its motion is steady, intentional, and rooted.
>
> **Symbol 3 – Women’s Circles (curve / spiral):**
> A flowing, organic symbol representing movement, cycles, intuition, and transformation.
> Its motion is non-linear — soft curves, spirals, and gentle rotation.
> It connects, weaves through, and softens the overall composition.
>
> **Symbol 4 – Families (father + child):**
> A relational symbol representing continuity, care, and human connection.
> Two elements in quiet dialogue — protection and growth side by side.
> Its motion expresses closeness, synchrony, and trust.
>
> The symbols may appear, fade in, rotate, grow, morph, or flow into one another.
> Starting and ending positions are not fixed — allow creative freedom.
>
> Over time, all four symbols harmoniously merge into a single, balanced final logo centered in the frame.
>
> **Style:** minimalist, natural, earthy, Scandinavian / Japanese-inspired
> **Color palette:** muted earth tones (warm brown, deep green, off-white background)
> **Texture:** subtle paper or organic grain
> **Mood:** calm, thoughtful, trustworthy, timeless
> **Motion:** slow, smooth, organic, no sharp cuts
> **Camera:** static or very subtle cinematic drift
> **Background:** clean and unobtrusive
>
> No text, no characters, no sound effects.
>
> End on a still frame of the final logo, perfectly balanced and suitable for a landing page hero section.
